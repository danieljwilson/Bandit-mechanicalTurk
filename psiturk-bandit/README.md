# GETTING STARTED WITH PSITURK
### My Experience (As a Complete Beginner)

####0. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

You probably have his already, but if not, get it.


####1. Download Anaconda Python Distribution

This is how they describe it:

>Completely free enterprise-ready Python distribution for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing

The download link is [here](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

I tried using the preinstalled version of python on my mac and had issues. This installation seemed to solve that.


####2. Install PsiTurk

Follow the [directions](http://psiturk.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) on the PsiTurk site. I would agree with their statement that:

>The easiest way to install **psiTurk** is via ``pip``.


####3. Install [Processing](https://processing.org/)

**Note**: This is required to adapt this particular bandit experiment, as I built it in Processing since my JavaScript skills don't exist (yet). Processing can publish to Javascript, but it definitely makes implementing the project with PsiTurk more cumbersome. If you can work in Javascript, do that.
